# Known Issues

1. **Whip Lash Damage**: The Spine Whip weapon ("whip lash") is currently not registering damage correctly against enemies.
2. **Item System Rework**: The current item verification system (stat boosts like +damage) is incoherent and needs a complete redesign ("fresh slate") to make gameplay sense.
